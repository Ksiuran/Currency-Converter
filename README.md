# Currency-Converter
This was a simple introductory project to Pythons JSON and REQUESTS modules. Currently there is no error or spelling checks so it should be very easy to break if you are not careful. However, it should be case insensitive on the currency codes, making "USD", "usd", and "uSD" all valid.
First input is the currency you will be converting from.
Second input is the currency you will be converting to.
Third input is the amount of the first currency you have.

EX:

USD

RUB

10

Would be trying to exchange 10 USD into RUB. After this first pass the program will only ask for two inputs, the currency to convert to and the amount.

EX:

NOK

50

This would be trying to convert 50 USD to NOK.
